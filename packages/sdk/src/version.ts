 * The package version, with exactly ONE source: package.json.

 * works unchanged from BOTH layouts this module lives in — src/ (vitest, tsx)
 * and dist/ (the published build) each sit one directory below the package
 * root, and package.json is always present in a published tarball.
 * (Same pattern as @basedagents/keyring src/version.ts — a hand-bumped copy
 * of the version nearly shipped lying once already.)
