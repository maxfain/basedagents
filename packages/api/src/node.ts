/**
 * Node.js entry point — local development and the Playwright E2E server.
 * Use: npx tsx src/node.ts
 *
 * Differences from the Workers deployment, all deliberate:
 *   - SQLite (better-sqlite3) instead of D1, registered via setNodeAdapter
 *     (the previous `app._nodeAdapter` injection was dead code — nothing read it);
 *   - the FULL migration chain (migrations/0001 … latest — the same files
 *     `wrangler d1 migrations apply` runs in prod) is replayed here, tracked in
 *     a _migrations table so each file runs exactly once (they contain
 *     non-idempotent ALTERs — never re-run one). Each file runs inside its own
 *     better-sqlite3 transaction, mirroring D1's implicit per-migration
 *     transaction, so a table-rebuild migration's `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys`
 *     (0035) is effective locally too. The file list lives in
 *     db/migration-list.ts and is shared with the schema tests. Two columns no
 *     migration defines (agents.webhook_url, agents.reputation_override — prod
 *     has them by hand) are added afterwards, guarded.
 *     A dev DB created by the old gap-list runner (schema.sql + 0021 + ≥0023)
 *     is upgraded in place: 0001…0022 apply on top, and a file whose ALTER hits
 *     an already-present column is tolerated and still recorded (the rest of
 *     that file is skipped). Anything else is fatal — `rm data/registry.db`
 *     (GOTCHAS.md). E2E DBs are always fresh (`rm -rf .e2e-data`).
 *   - process.env is passed as the Hono env, so KEYRING_RP_ID /
 *     KEYRING_ORIGINS / E2E / Stripe vars work exactly like Worker vars.
 *     E2E runs set: E2E=1 KEYRING_RP_ID=localhost
 *     KEYRING_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5174 KEYRING_CONSOLE_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5174
