/**
 * Acquisition reporting: the pure query layer shared by the bearer-token admin
 * endpoint (routes/acquisition.ts) and the console admin page
 * (control/admin.ts). Conversions are DERIVED from committed domain state
 * (tasks, delivery receipts, settled payments via PAID_WHERE) joined to the
 * attribution tables — client-reported telemetry can never appear here as a
 * conversion.
 *
 * Reading the numbers honestly:
 *   - Observed installations are distinct stable installation ids — not npm
 *     downloads, process launches or tools/list calls, and not people.
 *   - The COHORT view groups by when (and from where) an entity was acquired;
 *     the ACTIVITY view counts events inside the period. The two never share
 *     a denominator.
 *   - `unknown` is its own row, never renamed organic/direct/registry.
 *   - Buyer and worker attribution stay separate: one task's buyer and worker
 *     can come from different sources, and their USDC columns are never added
 *     together. Settled worker USDC is payouts, not revenue.
 *   - Human (console) buyers have no acquisition source in this model; they
 *     appear as the separate `human_buyer` bucket keyed on owner creation.
 *   - A 7-day returning agent had a successful meaningful (non-discovery) use
 *     in [entry+7d, entry+14d); cohorts younger than 14 days are immature and
 *     flagged rather than silently mixed in.
