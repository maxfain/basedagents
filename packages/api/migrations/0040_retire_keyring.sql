-- 0040: retire Keyring — drop the credential-vault tables and columns.
--
-- Keyring (the local credential vault, its approvals inbox, connect cards,
-- daemon endpoints, cloud passport and billing) is removed from the product;
-- the task marketplace is what remains. The owner-account layer it shared
-- with the marketplace stays untouched: owners, owner_webauthn_credentials,
-- webauthn_challenges, owner_sessions, action_assertions, delegations,
-- owner_recovery_*, magic_link_tokens, test_outbox, and the 0034 oauth_* tables.
-- funnel_events (0028) also stays: the marketplace records task_posted and
-- friends server-side (tasks/service.ts recordFunnel); only the anonymous
-- keyring onboarding pings and the provider vote tiles are gone.
--
-- Everything below is a plain drop. The tables are children of owners/agents
-- (or standalone counters), so no surviving row references them; link_codes
-- was only ever pointed at by magic_link_tokens.link_code_id, a plain nullable
-- column with no REFERENCES clause — it stays, unused, rather than rebuilding
-- the table. DROP COLUMN needs SQLite ≥ 3.35 (D1 and better-sqlite3 both are).
