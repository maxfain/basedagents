# One-time (per environment) runtime-secret setup for the owner control plane.
# Usage:
#   RESEND_API_KEY=re_... ./scripts/put-secrets.sh [--env staging]
#
# Reads secret VALUES from the environment (never from argv — argv leaks into
# `ps` and shell history), pipes each into `wrangler secret put`, and prints
# which were set or skipped. Skipping is fine: without RESEND_API_KEY the
# magic-link and recovery emails go to the log-only sender.
#
# Payments / escrow secrets (CDP_API_KEY_ID, CDP_API_KEY_SECRET,
# PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY, ESCROW_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY) are set interactively —
# see scripts/bootstrap-deploy.md.
