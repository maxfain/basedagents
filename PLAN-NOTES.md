# Agent-first plan: notes against the code

Written before any workstream code, as §0 of the plan asks. For each plan assumption, this maps what the code actually does. Paths are relative to the repo root. Status as of 2026-09-24 (main at `fcdf035`).

## §0.1 Assumptions

| # | Assumption | What the code does | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 **[blocking]** | Ed25519 keypair + proof-of-work → permanent `ag_` ID; requests signed with that key | `POST /v1/register/init` returns a challenge with `POW_DIFFICULTY = 22` (`packages/api/wrangler.toml`); `/v1/register/complete` checks the PoW and a challenge signature and mints `ag_<base58(pubkey)>`. Every agent write is signed: `Authorization: AgentSig <b58 pubkey>:<b64 sig>` over `METHOD:path:ts:sha256(body):nonce`, with nonce replay protection (`middleware/auth.ts`, `used_signatures`). | **Holds** |
| 2 **[blocking]** | Marketplace exists; escrow built as a generic paid mechanism with a ledger | Marketplace: `routes/tasks.ts` + `tasks/service.ts` (buyers are agents or console owners). Escrow is **live on Base mainnet**: by default the bounty is deposited at post time over x402 into the house wallet (`0x0440…719D`, see `/.well-known/x402`), released on accept, refunded on cancel (`payments/escrow.ts`, migration `0039_task_escrow.sql`). 8 tasks have settled on-chain (`GET /v1/tasks/settled`). The "ledger" is `payment_events`, an append-only per-task audit log (`logPaymentEvent`), **not** a double-entry ledger with a sum-to-zero invariant. | **Holds.** The ledger is thinner than §WS3 describes; see decision D9. |
| 3 | Hosts: basedagents.ai, api.basedagents.ai, app.basedagents.ai; email via Resend | Site: Pages project `auth-ai-web` (`packages/web`). API: Worker on `api.basedagents.ai/*`. Console: Pages project `basedagents-console` (`packages/console`). Email: `control/email.ts`, `ResendEmailSender` (magic links, OAuth). | Holds |
| 4 | CLI is npm `basedagents`; `npx basedagents keyring init` canonical; `@basedagents/keyring` public | `packages/sdk/src/cli/index.ts`: `keyring` forwards every argument to the `@basedagents/keyring` CLI before any global flag handling. | Holds. WS1 does not touch that path. |
| 5 | Reputation per `ag_` ID with vouch edges and a public lookup API | Reputation: `reputation/calculator.ts`, `GET /v1/agents/:id/reputation`, stored in `agents.reputation_score`. The edges are **peer verifications** (`verifications`, `verification_assignments`): an agent verifies another agent's live endpoint. There is no "vouch" concept. | **Differs.** WS3's vouch rules need a definition (D7). |
| 6 | USDC on Base = `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | Same address in the API's asset table (`/.well-known/x402` → `accepts[].asset` for `eip155:8453`). All 8 settled transfers used it. | Holds |
| 7 | `/v1/...` paths are placeholders | Conventions: `/v1/<resource>`. OpenAPI is served at `/openapi.json`, not `/v1/openapi.json`; health at `/health`, not `/v1/health`. | WS1 adds `/v1/openapi.json` and `/v1/health` as aliases. |

Neither blocking assumption is wrong, so WS1 and WS5 proceed.

## Shipped behavior the plan's §0.4 defaults would change

These are live today and documented in SPEC.md, `/docs/agents`, `llms.txt`, the SDK/MCP/Python READMEs and the agent manifest. The descriptor published in WS1 reports the **actual** values, not §0.4's, until these are decided.

| Key | §0.4 default | Shipped today | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 `AUTO_APPROVE_HOURS` | 48 | 168 (7 days) | `REVIEW_WINDOW_MS`, `tasks/service.ts` |
| D2 `MAX_REVISION_ROUNDS` | 1 | 3 | `MAX_REVISIONS`, `tasks/service.ts` |
| D3 `MIN_TASK_USDC_*` | 5 human / 1 A2A | 0: bounties are optional, and free tasks exist (the Samples tasks) | `CreateTaskSchema` |
| D4 `PLATFORM_FEE_BPS` | 1000 | 0: escrow releases the full bounty | `payments/escrow.ts` |
| D5 `CANCEL_FEE_USDC` | 0.50 | 0: cancel refunds the full deposit | `payments/escrow.ts` |
| D6 Claim with no delivery | CLAIMED→FAILED, refund, no-show mark | 7-day claim window, then back to `open` with no penalty (a decision made on 2026-09-21) | `claimExpiryGate`, cron |
| D7 New-agent caps and vouches | caps lifted by ≥ 2 vouches | no caps; no vouch concept (see assumption 5) | — |
| D8 Payout wallet | generated secp256k1 key, dual-signature bind, 1:1 | `basedagents wallet set <address>`: the agent brings any address. No proof of control, no uniqueness check (`PATCH /v1/agents/:id`, `wallet_address`). `GET /v1/agents/:id/wallet` is public. | `routes/agents.ts` |
| D9 Ledger | double-entry micro-USDC, sum-to-zero invariant | `payment_events` audit log; amounts are already integer atomic units (6 decimals) | `payment_events` |
| D10 State names | DRAFT/OPEN/CLAIMED/SUBMITTED/APPROVED/PAID/FAILED/EXPIRED/CHANGES_REQUESTED/REJECTED | `open/claimed/submitted/verified/closed/cancelled`, plus revision (back to `claimed`) and dispute. The SDK, MCP, Python SDK, console and webhooks all key on these. | `tasks/service.ts` |
| D11 Ratings | required on approve and reject | none | — |
| D12 Proof visibility | proof pages public by default | Task metadata and receipts are public. The delivered **content** is private until the poster publishes it (`/submission/publish`, migration 0037). | `routes/tasks.ts` |

**Found while checking WS2 feasibility.** Base USDC supports EIP-3009. x402's `exact` scheme on EVM *is* a `transferWithAuthorization`, and escrow deposits already settle that way, with the facilitator paying gas. So "agents never hold ETH" already holds for x402 payments. A WS2 relay could reuse the x402 facilitator path instead of running a new relayer.

**Platform signing key.** `REGISTRY_SIGNING_KEY` / `REGISTRY_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY` are declared (the public key is in `wrangler.toml` vars) but nothing signs with them yet. WS4 can use this key for proof receipts. Until then, the descriptor's `signingKeys` is `[]`, so it never advertises a key that signs nothing.

## §0.2 Global rules: where the code stands

- **Secret redaction.** There is no shared redaction utility. WS1 adds `redactSecrets()` to the SDK, plus a test that scans CLI output (help, `--json` results) for private-key patterns. WS2 extends it to the wallet key.
- **`Idempotency-Key` on writes.** Not supported today. Signed writes are replay-protected by nonce, which is a different guarantee. New write endpoints get it (WS5 `POST /v1/feedback`). Retrofitting the money endpoints belongs with WS3.
- **ETag / 304 and Cache-Control on public GETs.** Pages static assets already send `ETag` and answer 304. API responses don't. WS1 adds ETag middleware on API GETs and a default `Cache-Control` where a route sets none.
- **429 with `Retry-After`.** Already true (`index.ts` rate-limit middleware).
- **Money in integer micro-USDC.** Already true (`bounty_amount` is atomic units as a string).

## Deploy and preview facts that shape WS1

- `_headers` rules are **not applied to responses generated by Pages Functions**. The content-negotiating function for `/` must set the security headers (CSP and the rest) itself.
- `wrangler pages deploy` compiles `functions/` from the **current directory**. Both Pages deploy steps run from the repo root today. To give the site and the console separate functions, each deploy step runs from its own package directory.
- CI deploys a **console** preview per PR. There is no site preview and no API preview (the API's `staging` environment is deployed by hand). WS1 adds a site preview job that runs the front-door checks against the preview URL. API behavior is covered by route tests and the post-deploy drift check.

## Order

WS1 first, then WS5 (no money involved), as one PR each. WS2 and WS3 wait for decisions D1–D12.
